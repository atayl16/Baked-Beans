    <p>Hi, this site was built by me, Charlie Seaman. It was a personal project to try and identify the best baked beans. If you want to see my other projects, you can visit my main website <a href="https://casman.co.uk">http://casman.co.uk</a>.</p>
    <p>All of my social links are on my website linked above or you can email us at help@baked-bean.co.uk</p>
    <p>For more info on who and what made this possible, you can view the <a href="HUMANS.TXT">HUMANS.TXT</a> doc.</p>
